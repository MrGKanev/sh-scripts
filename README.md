## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/MrGKanev/sh-scripts.git
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:

   find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
   ```

3. Each script directory contains its own README with specific usage instructions.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Bash shell (version 4.0 or later recommended)
